    I obtained my Bachelor's degree from Naitional University of Singapore. After graduation, I joined the <a href="http://uav.ece.nus.edu.sg/">NUS UAV Research Group</a> and worked at <a href="http://www.temasek-labs.nus.edu.sg/">Temasek Laboratories</a> for two years.

    At present I am a first year PhD student in UCSD, and my supervisor is <a href="http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/faculty/faculty_bios/index.sfe?fmp_recid=409">Professor Nikolay Atanasov</a>. I am interested in computer vision and its application in mobile platforms, such as UAVs and cars.
