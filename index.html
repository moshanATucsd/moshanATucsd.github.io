    I am a second year PhD student in <a href="http://existentialrobotics.org/docs/index.html">Existential Robotics Lab</a> of UCSD, and my advisor is <a href="http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/faculty/faculty_bios/index.sfe?fmp_recid=409">Professor Nikolay Atanasov</a>. I am interested in computer vision and its application on mobile platforms, such as UAVs and cars.
