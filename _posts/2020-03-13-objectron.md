Recently I read about [this article](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/03/real-time-3d-object-detection-on-mobile.html) and was amazed by the app's ability to detect 3D objects in real time, so I decided to give it a try. 

I followed the [docker installation](https://github.com/google/mediapipe/blob/master/mediapipe/docs/install.md#installing-using-docker) to build the mediapipe first, then build the [objectdetection3d](https://github.com/google/mediapipe/tree/master/mediapipe/examples/android/src/java/com/google/mediapipe/apps/objectdetection3d) for android. This is the shoe detection only. 

The chair version is provided at [objectron](https://github.com/google/mediapipe/blob/master/mediapipe/docs/objectron_mobile_gpu.md).
