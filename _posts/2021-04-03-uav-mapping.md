title: Using UAV to map landmarks at UCSD
categories: blog 
tags:

UCSD has a collection of arts called the [Stuart Collection](https://stuartcollection.ucsd.edu/), I have learnt how to [opendronemap](https://github.com/moshanATucsd/DroneCamp-2020/blob/master/openDroneMap.md) to map the images collected from the UAV, so I thought it would be fun to create such imagings to the landmarks at UCSD as well:
