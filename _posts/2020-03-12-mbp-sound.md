title: Sound issue of MacBook Pro

I have a MacBook Pro and I often encounter this issue: when I put the laptop to hibernate, and then when I reopen the lid, I can not hear any sound.

Later I found [this post](https://www.zhihu.com/question/23498580), which indicates that this is not a hardware issue, but a bug of MacOS of coreaudiod. There are several ways to solve it:

* open activity monitor, search audio and find coreaudiod, exit from it, and it will restart.
* another way is to enter `sudo killall coreaudiod` in the terminal, or replug in the earphone.   
* restart is also an option.
