I have tried to customize my setup for these:

## zsh

add [autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions/blob/master/INSTALL.md) for zsh

## customized domain

- setup a customized domain following [this blog](https://richpauloo.github.io/2019-11-17-Linking-a-Custom-Domain-to-Github-Pages/)

- here's the setting that works for my site

- I am learning Spanish so the domain `me llamo sean` means `My name is Sean`, and I choose `cf` because it's short for `Club de FÃºtbol`

## vim

learn vim via [vim-adventure](https://vim-adventures.com/), vim is usually part of the customized environment, eg [this](https://medium.com/@jeantimex/how-to-configure-iterm2-and-vim-like-a-pro-on-macos-e303d25d5b5c) or [this](https://dev.to/danielshow/setting-up-vim-tmux-iterm-and-oh-my-zsh-5e51)
