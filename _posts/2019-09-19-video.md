On macOS, we need to follow these steps to make a video for paper submission:
* use keynote to make slides and animations  
* keynote has a record slide play function, it also can show notes
* after exporting the video, drag it to keynote again to change aspect ratio to widescreen
* use `HandBrake` to compress the video to within 20MB, frame rate > 20
* use `ffmpeg -i video_name` to check frame rate
