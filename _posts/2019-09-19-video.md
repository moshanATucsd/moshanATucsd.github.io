On macOS, we need to follow these steps to make a video for paper submission:
* use keynote to make slides and animations  
* keynote has a record slide play function, it also can show notes
* after exporting the video, drag it to keynote again to change aspect ratio to widescreen
* use `HandBrake` to compress the video to within 20MB, frame rate > 20
* use `ffmpeg -i video_name` to check frame rate

For Ubuntu, we can use `RecordMyDesktop` to record screen. Its output format is ogv, which
can be coverted to avi via `ffmpeg` as in [here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/17309/video-converter-ogv-to-avi-or-another-more-common-format)

```
ffmpeg -i input.ogv output.avi
```
