[Pangolin](https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin) is useful for visulization. The building process is

```
git clone https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin.git
cd Pangolin
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

However, we should NOT build in anaconda environment, as cmake cannot find openGL.

There is also a headless rendering mode `export PANGOLIN_WINDOW_URI=headless://`, but if we use this we may encounter error `OpenGL Error 500: GL_INVALID_ENUM: An unacceptable value is specified for an enumerated argument.`.

An sh file could be used to install pangolin, such as [this one](https://github.com/luigifreda/pyslam/blob/master/install_thirdparty.sh).
