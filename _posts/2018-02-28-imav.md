## IMAV

The 2015 International Micro Vehicle (IMAV) Competition was held in Aachen, Germany. NUS UAV Team V‐Lion, supervised by Prof Ben M. Chen, secured the 2nd place. The NUS team’s outstanding performance in a fire‐fighting mission was a big surprise to everyone on site. The mission included automatic take‐
off, water fetching and dumping, as well as automatic landing. The unusually strong wind gusts on the competition day did not deter the team’s great efforts. The performance of the NUS team was featured on the German TV and highlighted in the award ceremony.
